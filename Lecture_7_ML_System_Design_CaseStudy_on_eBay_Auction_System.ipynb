    "## Case Study Overview\n",
    "This case study investigates the online bidding system akin to eBay, designed to facilitate product auctions. It incorporates two primary users: sellers who list items for auction and buyers who submit bids. The notes explore core requirements, system design, and inherent challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Requirements\n",
    "1. **Post an Item for Auction by Seller**\n",
    "   - Sellers must provide:\n",
    "     - Starting price (e.g., 12 Rs)\n",
    "     - End time for the auction\n",
    "     - Product details (description, images, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Post a Bid on Auction Item by Buyer**\n",
    "   - Bids must exceed the current highest bid.\n",
    "   - Example: If the highest bid is 12 Rs, only bids of 13 Rs or higher will be accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **View Highest Bidding Price**\n",
    "   - Users should dynamically view the real-time highest bid price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Out of Scope:**\n",
    "- Searching the catalog.\n",
    "- Auction history.\n",
    "- Payment services integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "1. **High Consistency:** Ensuring all users see the latest bid data accurately.\n",
    "2. **Fault Tolerance and Durability:** The system must retain all bids and recover from failures.\n",
    "3. **Scalability:** Supporting up to 10 million concurrent users.\n",
    "4. **Low Latency for High Bid Views:** Instant visibility of the current highest bid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Out of Scope:**\n",
    "- Monitoring.\n",
    "- Observability.\n",
    "- Security.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Core Entities in the System\n",
    "### Key Tables\n",
    "1. **Auction Table**\n",
    "   - Attributes include:\n",
    "     - `id`\n",
    "     - `item_id`\n",
    "     - `start_date`\n",
    "     - `end_date`\n",

    "     - `name`\n",
    "     - `description`\n",
    "     - `image_links`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale for Separate Item Table\n",
    "A separate item table allows for easier modifications to item details without impacting ongoing auctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Design\n",
    "### Key API Endpoints\n",
    "1. **Post Auction Item**\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-Level Design\n",
    "### Functional Flow\n",
    "1. **Client Interaction:**\n",
    "   Clients connect through an API Gateway that routes to the respective services (auction or bid).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Client --> API Gateway --> Auction Service --> Database\n",
    "                ---> Bid Service --> Database\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Database Structure:**\n",
    "   Tables for Auctions, Items, and Bids facilitate efficient data handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auction Table Example\n",
    "| Column Name       | Data Type  | Description                      |\n",
    "|-------------------|------------|----------------------------------|\n",
    "| id                | INT        | Primary key                      |\n",
    "| item_id           | INT        | ID referencing the item          |\n",
    "| start_date        | DATETIME   | Auction starting date            |\n",
    "| end_date          | DATETIME   | Auction ending date              |\n",
    "| starting_price    | DECIMAL    | Initial bid price                |\n",
    "| user_id           | INT        | Seller's user ID                 |\n",

    "| Column Name       | Data Type  | Description                                  |\n",
    "|-------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| id                | INT        | Primary key                                  |\n",
    "| name              | VARCHAR    | Name of the product                          |\n",
    "| description       | TEXT       | Description of the product                   |\n",
    "| image_links       | TEXT       | Links to product images                      |\n",
    "\n",

    "## Fault Tolerance and Durability\n",
    "### Fault Tolerance\n",
    "**Definition**: The ability of a system to continue functioning correctly in the event of a failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Principles**:\n",
    "  - **Redundancy**: Backup components to manage system failures.\n",
    "  - **Graceful Degradation**: System performance should gracefully reduce instead of failing completely.\n",
    "  - **Failover Mechanisms**: Automatically switch to standby components when a failure occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Durability\n",
    "**Definition**: Ensuring data and models are preserved over time, even in failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Principles**:\n",
    "  - **Persistent Storage**: Utilize reliable storage solutions (e.g., Amazon S3).\n",
    "  - **Replication**: Maintain multiple data copies across different locations.\n",
    "  - **Versioning and Backups**: Ensure that various data versions exist for rollback capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concurrency and Consistency\n",
    "### Consistency Problems & Solutions\n",
    "**Definition**: Ensuring that all users see the same correct version of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Strong Consistency**: Every read retrieves the latest write immediately.\n",
    "2. **Eventual Consistency**: Data may initially be stale but will become consistent over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Techniques to Ensure Consistency**:\n",
    "- **Database Transactions (ACID)**: Ensuring strict data integrity.\n",
    "- **Distributed Consensus Protocols**: Utilizing protocols like Paxos or Raft to manage distributed systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concurrency Problems & Solutions\n",
    "**Definition**: Issues arising when multiple processes access shared resources simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Race Condition**: Multiple processes modify shared data concurrently.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Use appropriate locking mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lost Updates**: One update can overwrite another due to concurrent access.\n",
    "   - **Solution**: Implement versioning or timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Concurrency\n",
    "- **Pessimistic Locking**: Locks a resource exclusively.\n",
    "- **Optimistic Locking**: Users access resources with checks for conflicts before committing changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Locking Mechanisms\n",
    "### Pessimistic Locking\n",
    "**Exclusive Locking** allows only one user access at a time, protecting data integrity.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "SELECT * FROM bids WHERE auction_id = ? FOR UPDATE;\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimistic Locking\n",
    "This mechanism permits reading without locking but requires checks for changes prior to updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Utilizing Redis for Caching\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "Use Redis to store the maximum bid of each auction for rapid access and enhanced performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Redis Integration**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import redis\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to Redis\n",
    "r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Store maximum bid\n",
    "r.set('auction:1:max_bid', 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Retrieve the maximum bid\n",
    "max_bid = r.get('auction:1:max_bid')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- Reduces load on the database.\n",
    "- Quickens the retrieval of maximum bid data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- Potential inconsistencies can arise if Redis and the database are out of sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trade-offs of System Design\n",
    "- **Performance vs. Consistency**: A balance must be maintained; faster responses may introduce inconsistencies.\n",
    "- **Locking Trade-offs**: Heavy locking can reduce performance due to limited concurrency.\n",
    "- **Caching Benefits**: Although Redis caching speeds up access times, it poses risks regarding data consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schema Design\n",
    "### Auction Table Schema\n",
