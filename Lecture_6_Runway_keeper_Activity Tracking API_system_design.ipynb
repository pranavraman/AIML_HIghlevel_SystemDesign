    "\n",
    "def haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n",
    "    R = 6371.0  # Earth radius in kilometers\n",
    "    phi1 = math.radians(lat1)\n",
    "    phi2 = math.radians(lat2)\n",
    "    delta_phi = math.radians(lat2 - lat1)\n",
    "    delta_lambda = math.radians(lon2 - lon1)\n",
    "    a = math.sin(delta_phi / 2.0) ** 2 + math.cos(phi1) * math.cos(phi2) * math.sin(delta_lambda / 2.0) ** 2\n",
    "    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n",
    "    distance = R * c\n",
    "    return distance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "lat1, lon1 = 40.7128, -74.0060  # New York\n",
    "lat2, lon2 = 34.0522, -118.2437  # Los Angeles\n",
    "distance = haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)\n",
    "print(f\"Distance between New York and Los Angeles: {distance:.2f} km\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential ML Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The current system does not include ML, but the following applications can enhance functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Definition and Purpose\n",
    "Recommendations suggest personalized content, such as running routes or friends, based on user data. This increases engagement by tailoring the app to individual preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Techniques\n",
    "- **Collaborative Filtering**:\n",
    "  - **User-based**: Recommends routes or friends based on similarities with other users’ activity patterns.\n",
    "  - **Item-based**: Suggests routes similar to those the user has completed.\n",
    "- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends routes based on features like distance, elevation, or terrain that match the user’s past activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Example\n",
    "A user who runs 5km routes with moderate elevation might receive recommendations for similar routes in their area, based on their activity history.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Flowchart\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph TD\n",
    "    A[User Activities] --> B{Process Data}\n",
    "    B --> C[User Profiles]\n",
    "    B --> D[Route Features]\n",
    "    C --> E[Find Similar Users]\n",
    "    D --> F[Find Similar Routes]\n",
    "    E --> G[Recommend Routes/Friends]\n",
    "    F --> G\n",
    "    G --> H[Present Recommendations]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Implementation\n",
    "- **Data**: User activity data (type, duration, distance, pace), route features (GPS logs), social connections.\n",
    "- **Algorithm Example**: Use a library like [Surprise](http://surpriselib.com/) for collaborative filtering.\n",
    "- **Challenges**: Privacy concerns for friend recommendations; cold start for new users (solved by using content-based filtering initially).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Anomaly Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Definition and Purpose\n",
    "Anomaly detection identifies unusual activities, such as abnormal pace or location, to flag potential errors or cheating, ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Techniques\n",
    "- **Clustering**: Groups similar activities; outliers are flagged as anomalies.\n",
    "- **Isolation Forests**: Isolates anomalies by recursively partitioning data.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Example\n",
    "A user’s running pace of 2 minutes/km (world-record level) compared to their usual 6 minutes/km could be flagged for review.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Flowchart\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph TD\n",
    "    A[User Activities] --> B{Train Model}\n",

    "- **Algorithm Example**: Use [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for isolation forests.\n",
    "- **Challenges**: Defining anomaly thresholds; minimizing false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Gamification\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Definition and Purpose\n",
    "Gamification uses game elements like challenges and badges to boost user engagement. ML can personalize these elements based on user behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Techniques\n",
    "- **Predictive Modeling**: Predicts when users might disengage to offer timely challenges.\n",
    "- **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimizes challenge design based on user responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Example\n",
    "A user running three times a week could be challenged to run four times, earning a badge upon completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Flowchart\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph TD\n",
    "    A[User Activities] --> B{Analyze Patterns}\n",
    "    B --> C[Predict Engagement]\n",
    "    C --> D[Design Challenges]\n",
    "    D --> E[Present Challenges]\n",
    "    E --> F[Monitor Response]\n",
    "    F --> G[Adjust Strategy]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Implementation\n",
    "- **Data**: User activity data, engagement metrics (e.g., login frequency).\n",
    "- **Algorithm Example**: Use [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for predictive modeling.\n",
    "- **Challenges**: Balancing challenge difficulty; ensuring scalability.\n",
    "\n",
