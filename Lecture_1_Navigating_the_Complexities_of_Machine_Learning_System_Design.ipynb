    "### Explanation of DNS\n",
    "\n",
    "**DNS (Domain Name System)** is a hierarchical naming system that translates domain names into IP addresses. Every server on the internet has a unique IP address that allows devices to locate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Process of Accessing Facebook\n",
    "1. **Browser Request**: When a user enters `facebook.com` in the browser, the request goes to the DNS resolver.\n",
    "2. **DNS Resolution**: The DNS resolver queries a series of DNS servers to find the corresponding IP address for `facebook.com`.\n",
    "3. **Connection**: The browser establishes a connection to the Facebook server using its IP address.\n",
    "4. **Server Response**: The Facebook server processes the request and returns the HTML, JSON, or other data formats required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code\n",

    "## Question: What are Latency Problems in FB Responses?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Latency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latency** is defined as the time delay experienced between sending a request and receiving a response. It is a crucial factor in user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**: If a request takes 50 ms to travel from the user's device to the server and back, this 50 ms is considered latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dealing with Latency\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Proximity**: Reducing latency involves locating databases closer to the relevant application servers.\n",
    "2. **Code/Data Management**: Having code and data together can achieve very low latency, but it poses risks since both are lost if the server fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage Challenge\n",
    "If a server’s code size is 10 MB and data is 1 TB, dividing 1 TB into two 500 GB portions may not be feasible due to fragmentation.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Vertical Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vertical Scaling**, also known as \"scaling up,\" involves adding more resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) to an existing server. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scale from 1 TB storage with 8 GB RAM to 2 TB with 16 GB RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "- Simplicity: Easy to implement as it requires less architectural change.\n",
    "- No changes in application code usually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "- Single Point of Failure: If the server fails, everything goes down.\n",
    "- Limited by hardware constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Horizontal Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Horizontal Scaling**, or \"scaling out,\" involves adding more servers to distribute the load. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split 1 TB with 8 GB RAM into three servers: 1 TB with 8 GB RAM each.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "- Redundancy: If one server fails, others can take over, enhancing reliability.\n",
    "- Flexibility: Can handle increasing loads by simply adding more servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",

    "## Question: Which One Should I Prefer? Vertical or Horizontal?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing Between Vertical and Horizontal Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision between vertical and horizontal scaling depends on various factors such as cost, requirements, architecture, and expected load. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Scenario\n",
    "Consider a financial company that deployed an ML model using a horizontal scaling system. However, performance issues arose due to the app slowing down.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Definition of a Load Balancer\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Load Balancer** is a critical component in distributed systems that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers. This ensures no single server becomes a bottleneck and enables higher availability and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Load Balancers Work\n",
    "- When a user, say **Vaibhav**, accesses Facebook, his request goes to a Load Balancer (LB).\n",
    "- The Load Balancer has a public IP and forwards requests to the appropriate server based on where the relevant data is stored (for example, databases categorized by names).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Load Balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Traffic Distribution**: Efficiently distributes user requests making the application responsive.\n",
    "2. **Fault Tolerance**: If one server fails, the load balancer reroutes traffic to operational servers.\n",

    "## Question: Authentication, Rate Limiter, Security, and Catching Hackers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system, often by requiring users to provide credentials such as usernames and passwords. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods of Authentication\n",
    "1. **Basic Authentication**: Uses a simple username and password combination.\n",
    "2. **OAuth**: Allows third-party applications to access user data without exposing credentials.\n",
    "3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a mobile device or email verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rate Limiter\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Rate Limiter** controls the number of requests a user can make to an API in a given time period. This helps to prevent abuse and ensures service stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Rate Limiting Works\n",
    "- **Token Bucket Algorithm**: Each user gets a \"bucket\" with a fixed number of tokens. Each request consumes a token, and tokens are replenished at a set rate.\n",
    "- **Leaky Bucket Algorithm**: Requests are processed at a constant rate regardless of how they come in, smoothing out bursts of volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encryption**: Protect sensitive data by encrypting it both in transit (using SSL/TLS) and at rest.\n",
    "2. **Access Controls**: Implement role-based access controls to ensure that users only have permissions necessary for their tasks.\n",
    "3. **Regular Audits**: Conduct audit trails to track and log access to sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Catching Hackers\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify potential breaches, APIs can log unusual access patterns. If a single IP address attempts to make hundreds of requests in a short time, it could indicate a bot or a hacker trying to exploit the system.\n",

    "### Scenario Description\n",
    "\n",
    "When a video on YouTube goes viral, it can experience a massive increase in views and requests, surging from 100 requests per second to 10,000. Handling this requires robust architectural designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preferred Architecture Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Microservices Architecture**: \n",
    "   - **Description**: Decomposes applications into multiple loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: Enhances scalability and fault isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monolithic Architecture**:\n",
    "   - **Description**: Combines all functionalities into a single unified unit.\n",
    "   - **Disadvantages**: Scaling can become difficult, especially during high loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy for Handling Increased Load\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load Balancer**: The load balancer directs user requests to various servers.\n",
    "2. **Replication**: Use slave databases that replicate the video data. Requests can be served from these slaves rather than overloading the master database.\n",
    "3. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Distribute copies of the video to global locations, reducing latency and load on the master server.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Analogy\n",
    "Imagine needing to buy groceries and going to the store every single time for items like milk or sugar. Instead, a fridge keeps these necessities handy for quick access—hence, cache serves a similar purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Cache\n",
    "- **Memory Cache**: Fast storage in RAM (e.g., Memcached, Redis).\n",
    "- **Disk Cache**: Slower than memory but larger storage capacity.\n",

    "### Definition of Cookies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cookies** are small pieces of data stored by web browsers that remember user preferences, sessions, and other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How They Work Together\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When a user accesses a webpage for the first time, data is pulled from the server (slow).\n",
    "2. Data is cached in memory for faster access next time.\n",

    "## Question: ML Stuff in System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Machine Learning in System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration of machine learning into system design introduces additional layers of complexity and consideration. It’s crucial to differentiate standard system design questions from those that specifically pertain to machine learning applications. Below are several key aspects to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Is It Really an ML/DL/AI Problem?**\n",
    "   - **Evaluation**: Begin with validating whether the problem truly relies on machine learning techniques or if traditional programming approaches could suffice. For instance, classifying video content based on violence, nudity, or general interest might necessitate an AI solution, while simpler data retrieval operations could merely require standard database queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ML Lifecycle in System Design**\n",
    "   - The ML lifecycle consists of several vital steps that interface with broader system design goals:\n",
    "     1. **Functional Requirements**: What ML tasks does the system need to accomplish? This could include prediction, classification, or regression tasks.\n",
    "     2. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, scalability, and data privacy must all be addressed.\n",
    "     3. **Data Preparation**: Gather and preprocess the data required for effective ML tasks.\n",
    "     4. **Model Selection**: Choose the right machine learning algorithms that fit the dataset and problem statement.\n",
    "     5. **Evaluation**: Regularly assess the model's performance to ensure it meets the necessary accuracy and reliability standards.\n",
    "     6. **Deployment**: Integrate the ML model into the existing system through CI/CD pipelines for seamless updates.\n",
    "     7. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the model’s performance in production to adapt to changes in data patterns and to initiate retraining when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Video Classification with AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider a practical application in an online platform:\n",
    "- A video uploaded by a user needs classification to filter out inappropriate content. Instead of processing this with simple filtration rules, an AI model could analyze the video to detect violent or explicit content.\n",
    "- This would follow the ML lifecycle outlined above from data gathering through evaluation to deployment.\n",

    "### Considerations for ML System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Data**: Be prepared to manage large datasets, including storage solutions and efficient retrieval systems, while ensuring compliance with data protection laws.\n",
    "2. **Computational Resources**: Scalability requirements may differ for training vs. inference stages; practical approaches must consider GPU usage for training large models.\n",
    "3. **Service Communication**: Design APIs for model serving that enable easy integration with different application components, maintaining a clear interface.\n",
    "4. **Real-time vs. Batch Processing**: Decide whether certain tasks need real-time responses or if they can be processed in batches during off-peak times.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Homework Implementations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implementations**: Applying theoretical knowledge through hands-on projects strengthens understanding. Suggested tasks could include:\n",
