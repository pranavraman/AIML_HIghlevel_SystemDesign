    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Machine Learning System Design\n",
    "The goal of this course is to empower students with practical approaches to machine learning system design to prepare them for interviews and real-world application. Feedback indicated success in helping students grasp complex concepts and better articulate their thoughts during interviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of Human Instruction\n",

    "The cold start problem refers to the difficulty in making predictions with insufficient data or guidance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation:\n",
    "When faced with this in an interview:\n",
    "1. Take a moment to frame your thoughts.\n",
    "2. Outline your strategy before articulating your response.\n",

    "## Case Study: Ambiguity in Reference to “Jaguar”\n",
    "### Problem Statement:\n",
    "Design a system to determine whether the term \"Jaguar\" in given sentences refers to an animal or a car without using Neural Language Models (NLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Sentences:\n",
    "1. \"The Jaguar is a solitary predator native to the rainforest.\"\n",
    "2. \"I test drove a Jaguar F-type at the dealership yesterday.\"\n",
    "3. \"Jaguars are often confused with leopards.\"\n",
    "4. \"The Jaguar X-Tay Sedan offers a luxurious ride.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Data Collection:**\n",
    "   - Gather data from various sources (Wikipedia, wildlife forums, car dealership information).\n",
    "   - Ensure to clean the dataset to exclude ambiguous references like sports teams or products named \"Jaguar.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Preprocessing Steps:**\n",
    "   - **Tokenization:** Break sentences into individual tokens (words).\n",
    "   - **Lowercasing:** Normalize text to one case.\n",
    "   - **Punctuation Removal:** Remove punctuation that does not add meaningful information.\n",
    "   - **Stop Words Removal:** Eliminate common words that serve little purpose in classification (e.g., “the,” “is”).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools:\n",
    "- Libraries such as **NLTK** and **SpaCy** are ideal for preprocessing actions.\n",
    "\n",
