    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Processing and Feature Engineering\n",
    "### ETL Process\n",
    "- **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)**: \n",
    "   - A critical process that in the industry often combines extraction, transformation, and loading using comprehensive tools such as:\n",
    "     - **Informatica**\n",
    "     - **Alteryx**\n",
    "     - **Dataiku DSS**\n",
    "     - **AWS Glue**: This tool can perform all three steps efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Cleaning and Transformation\n",
    "- Performing thorough data cleaning involves addressing missing values, identifying outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering Techniques\n",
    "- **Distance Calculations**: Using the Haversine formula for accurate geographical distance computations.\n",
    "- Designing special features that incorporate:\n",
    "  - Restaurant characteristics such as type and average preparation times.\n",
    "  - Rider-specific metrics, including workload and past delivery performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timing for ETL\n",
    "- The ETL process should initiate daily or when significant events occur, such as:\n",
    "   - Updates in S3\n",
    "   - Riders' location changes affecting ETA predictions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "- **AWS Lambda** can trigger ETL events, allowing dynamic scale handling as order quantities fluctuate. In one order instance, machine learning algorithms may execute numerous times to update predictions in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Encoding Techniques\n",
    "1. **One-Hot Encoding**: Converts categorical variables into a binary matrix format.\n",
    "2. **Target Encoding**: Encodes categorical variables based on the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "3. **Ordinal Encoding**: Assigns integer values to ordinal categories.\n",
    "4. **Pre-trained Model Embeddings**: For high cardinality feature representation. Given there are approximately 1 million restaurants in Zomato’s database, encoding restaurant names appropriately is crucial.\n",
    "   - **Example**: QSR (Quick Service Restaurants) and biryani-specific outlets might have similar preparation times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geo-Hashing\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Geo-hashing encodes latitude and longitude into a short string, making it easier to manage geographic data. \n",
    "   - **Example**: Amazon may use a 5-character precision while Swiggy might opt for a 9-character precision, depending on the necessity for accuracy in densely populated areas.\n",

    "  - LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "  - Neural Networks (NN)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment\n",
    "- Once training is completed, models are deployed via **endpoints**, allowing them to be exposed as REST APIs for real-time predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## AWS Lambda Function for Predictions\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inferential Statistics\n",
    "### Statistical Methods Used\n",
    "1. **Confidence Intervals**: To provide users with a range of possible ETAs, indicating prediction uncertainty.\n",
    "   - Example: If the predicted ETA is 30 minutes with a confidence interval of ±5 minutes, the user can expect delivery between 25 and 35 minutes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Hypothesis Testing**:\n",
    "   - **Model Performance Comparison**:\n",
    "     - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: No significant difference exists between Model A and Model B's prediction errors.\n",
    "     - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: A significant difference exists in prediction accuracy.\n",
    "   - **Impact of New Features**:\n",
    "     - Evaluate the significance of any new features added to the model.\n",
    "     - **H0**: Adding the new feature does not improve prediction accuracy.\n",
    "     - **H1**: Adding the new feature significantly improves prediction accuracy.\n",
    "   - **A/B Testing for System Changes**:\n",
    "     - Comparing two versions of the ETA prediction system to analyze improvements.\n",
    "     - **H0**: No significant difference in accuracy or user satisfaction between the old and new systems.\n",
    "     - **H1**: The new system significantly improves accuracy or user satisfaction.\n",
